**Roshani Wright's SD Challenge**

For this challenge, I had to implement a nav bar to navigate to the three pages of the site. I added code to header.js to implement my nav bar. The branch with my successful attempt is 'header'.

Since I'm new to this coding language, I made a few changes to the website when I was playing around with the code. Sorry for any inconvenience.
